## To-Do
- [x] Register service with Gateway API
- [x] Distributed Logging
- [ ] Logger (Console, File)
- [ ] Security
- [x] RESTful Web Service (CRUD)
- [x] Docker


## Running the tests
Run command 
```
gradlew test
``` 

### Break down into end to end tests

Integration tests available only and are designed to run independently with and embedded database.
Also while running the tests it is not required to have the GatewayAPI server online.


## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a this application on your local machine.
One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.mg.smartrent.property.PropertyApplication` class from your IDE.


Alternatively you can use the gradle to run the project:

```shell
gradlew run
```

Or you can build the Docker image. Open CMD and navigation to project root folder, then run 
 * ``docker build -t sr-property-service .`` - this will create docker image of the application 
 * ``docker run -d -p 8083:8083 sr-property-service`` - this will run docker container with the created image
